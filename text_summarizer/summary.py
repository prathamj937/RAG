#     sample = """In Q2 2025, the global technology consulting market witnessed moderate growth amid economic uncertainties and shifting digital priorities. Enterprises continued investing in AI and automation, though many slowed spending on large-scale transformation projects. EY‚Äôs consulting practice adapted by emphasizing value-driven advisory services and scalable digital strategies tailored to sector-specific needs.

# The Financial Services sector showed the strongest resilience, driven by regulatory changes and increased focus on cybersecurity. Meanwhile, the Consumer Products and Retail segments experienced a decline in consulting demand due to reduced consumer spending and supply chain disruptions.

# Talent retention remained a key challenge, with attrition rates stabilizing but not declining significantly. EY‚Äôs ‚ÄúFuture-Ready Workforce‚Äù program‚Äîlaunched earlier this year‚Äîhas started showing positive results in upskilling employees in data analytics, cloud services, and agile delivery models. The initiative has been especially impactful in the Asia-Pacific region.

# Operationally, the consulting division introduced an AI-powered delivery excellence framework. This framework leverages internal data, client KPIs, and project outcomes to provide real-time quality insights and improve delivery consistency. Internal adoption of the tool has reached 62%, with a target of 85% by Q4.

# From a financial perspective, revenue grew 4.7% YoY, with the EMEA region showing the highest increase (7.9%), driven by strong demand in digital risk and regulatory compliance. However, North America saw a marginal decline (‚Äì1.1%) due to client budget tightening in the TMT (Technology, Media, Telecom) sector.

# In terms of sustainability consulting, EY expanded its Net Zero advisory services. Collaborations with three major energy providers are underway to build transparent ESG dashboards using satellite data and AI modeling. The aim is to provide predictive insights into emissions and compliance trajectories.

# Looking ahead to Q3 and Q4, the firm plans to further integrate GenAI into client delivery, focusing on document intelligence and code review automation. This shift is expected to streamline 12‚Äì15% of manual tasks in large transformation programs.

# Overall, the consulting practice remains focused on agility, sector relevance, and AI-powered value delivery."""
